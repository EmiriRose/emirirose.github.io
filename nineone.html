	<h1>BEACON RECEIVED</h1>
	<h3>You repair your distress beacon. You press a button on the screen and you wait for confirmation that your beacon has been received. You wait patiently for 20 minutes before the holographic text appears out of your beacon and says "Distress Beacon Received." Help is on the way. You have been saved.</h3>
